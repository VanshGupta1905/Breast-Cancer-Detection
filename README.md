Detecting wether patient has Breast Cancer or Not 
Using Deep Learning

## Early and Accurate Breast Cancer Prediction through Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a reliable breast cancer detection model using logistic regression, a powerful statistical method within the realm of deep learning. By analyzing key features extracted from patient data, our model aims to accurately predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not.

# Key Features

# Logistic Regression Model:
Leverages a robust logistic regression algorithm trained on a curated dataset to identify patterns associated with breast cancer.
Feature Extraction: Carefully selects relevant features (e.g., tumor size, texture, shape, etc.) that contribute significantly to accurate predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Employs techniques like normalization and feature scaling to ensure optimal model performance.
Model Evaluation: Rigorously assesses model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate its effectiveness.
